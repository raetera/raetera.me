# Rxyhn's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website. It is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ images
    â”œâ”€â”€ components
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ sections
    â”œâ”€â”€ icons
    â”œâ”€â”€ layouts
    â”œâ”€â”€ lib
    â”œâ”€â”€ pages
    â”œâ”€â”€ scripts
    â””â”€â”€ styles
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
